        <p>Welcome to <a href="http://MyIchimoku.eu">MyIchimoku.eu</a></p>

<p><a href="http://MyIchimoku.eu">MyIchimoku.eu</a> is a web application built to help trading stock by the use of Ichimoku Kinko Hyo charts.
It is for my personal use really.</p>

<p>Its purpose it to store historical stock data, collect daily updates and analyse the data based on the Ichimoku trading method.
The application provides suggestions for symbols that look attractive based on the technical analysis, provides buy and sell signals, contains manageble lists of favorites, actual portfolio and historical portfolio as well as an interactive trading plan.</p>

<p>Making this work vailable to the public also means that I would be greatly interested in your participation improving the code as this really is my first ever PHP/MySQL script. </p>

<p>As it analyses the Ichimoku method in small logical steps and creates 'signal points' for each step, I introduced a 'MyIchimoku Signal' which summarises the strength on a daily basis.
The application uses standard open source software such as PHP, MySQL, JQuery (and a number of it's plug-in's) and probably a few others. Thanks!! :-) .</p>

<p>In addition to this <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/">Yahoo! YQL</a> is used for stock data feeds, though some historical data was provided by <a href="http://www.abcbourse.com/">ABC Bourse</a>. 
The JQuery charting plugin comes from <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> (great tool really, you should have a look at their website). 
Icons are provided by <a href="http://www.doublejdesign.co.uk/">Doubje-J Design</a>.</p>

<p>Last but not least: the Ichimoku trading basics where provided by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/manesh-patel/2/a08/a85">Manesh Patel</a>, by use of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Ichimoku-Clouds-Essential-Technical/dp/0470609931/">his book</a> which would never have happened if I wouldn't have had an impuls purchase of this book: <a href="http://livre.fnac.com/a3630437/Daniel-Allemann-Les-secrets-de-trading-d-un-moine-bouddhiste">Secrets de trading d'un moine bouddhiste</a> from <a href="http://www.choisirmavie.com/">Daniel Alleman</a>.
MERCI Daniel! After 20 years of absence on the stock trading market you got me back on track :-)</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>
