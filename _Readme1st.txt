Hello Earthling!

Thanks for making the effort to have a look at MyIchimoku Application.
Besides the code that I wrote that is covered via the  Non Commercial license in the license file in this same directory, please note 
that I make use of several other 'tools' that allowed me to stitch this application together. These tools each have their respective lisences
and as such require to be respected.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT 
ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The application uses standard open source software such as PHP, MySQL, JQuery (and a number of it's plug-in's) 
and probably a few others. Thanks!! :-) .

In addition to this Yahoo! YQL (http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/) is used for stock data feeds, though some historical data 
was provided by ABC Bourse (http://www.abcbourse.com/). 
The JQuery charting plugin comes from Highcharts
(great tool really, you should have a look at their website > http://www.highcharts.com/ *** AND READ THEIR LICENSE ***). 

Icons are provided by Doubje-J Design (http://www.doublejdesign.co.uk/).
Last but not least: the Ichimoku trading basics where provided by Manesh Patel (http://www.linkedin.com/pub/manesh-patel/2/a08/a85), 
by use of his book which would never have happened if I wouldn't have had an impuls purchase of this book: 
"Secrets de trading d'un moine bouddhiste" from Daniel Alleman (http://www.choisirmavie.com/).

MERCI Daniel! After 20 years of absence on the stock trading market you got me back on track :-)

In short:
- Read the above if you haven't yet
- Read the license file
- Read the install file
- Use the application
- Contribute

Enjoy!
